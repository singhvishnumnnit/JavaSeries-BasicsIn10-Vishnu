> _Java is one of the most popular programming languages. Java offers both object-oriented and functional programming features. This series assumes no previous (beginner) programming or Java experience. This series will clear your all the basics doubts. If youâ€™ve never programmed a computer before, or if you already have experience with another programming language and want to quickly learn Java, this is a perfect series for you._

## [Java Series Section 1: Series Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhkK7Rbd07o)
In the first video I have just described about what we are going to learn in this series. Total there are 6 section in this series.

# SECTIONS:

## SECTION 1. Basics of Java:
* ### Java Introduction
> * In today's time the demand for this Programming Language is very high. let me tell you one interesting thing about this language. At present, Java code is used in more than 3000000 electronic devices. From this you can guess how popular this programming language is.
> * It is used in all the Smart Phones you are using and Electronic Devices like AC, Oven, Smart TV, Digital Fridge. Programming different parts in the equipment of some Automated Industries. If you want to learn Android Programming, then it is very important to learn Java. So let's know what is Java.
> #### What is Java?
> Java is a programming language and a platform. It was developed by the company named Sun MicroSystems in 1995 which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Now oracle manages and releases different versions of java. Java was created by a team led by James Gosling at Sum MicroSystems.
> Java is used for the Developement of the Softwares and Applications.
> - **Software** is a program requirement to collect the data and information to command the computer to function. It corresponds with the hardware on which the machine is built and truly accomplishes the task. Particularly, it does not require any user interaction to work, as it has the ability to work on itself once the computer or device is started. It is the mediator between the hardware and the user. `Examples- Operating System Softwares, Device Driver Softwares, Utility Softwares, Malicious Softwares`
> - **Applications** is a type of software program that is developed to perform a particular activity on a computer or a device. `Every application is software`. The function is directly used, launched, and interacted with by the ultimate user. It is an operating system based program. An app can do one task specifically or some integrated tasks together (depending on its development). `The tasks performed by an app can be manipulation of numbers, texts, audio, visual graphics, or a combination of them all. Examples- Database Softwares, Editting Software, Educational Software, Mathematical Soft. Entertainment Soft. etc.`
